Scriptable Brush
================

The implementation of the scriptable brush system which is based on the brush JavaScript files. 
A brush JavaScript file contains variables, painting logic, erasing logic and setup functions.

-  All brush files are loaded while editor is opening.
-  A brush file can create a brush instance by selecting the brush type in the drop-down list and clicking new brush 
   button on the brush window and assign variable through the editor. After a new brush instance is created, an XML 
   file will be generated for saving the assigned variable's value.
-  All of the brush instances will contain a name variable. This variable is for the XML file name and displaying name in the brush window.

Road Brush
~~~~~~~~~~

Road brush includes an array of tiles with grids. The feature of this brush is to paint a continuing road. 
Based on the top, right, bottom, and left side of the tile, it will try to paint the best tile, 
in the array of tiles, in the giving coordinate. In order to paint a road, the user has to define 
the road information, helping editor to determine that every edge of tile should connect the way or not.

For example, if the user tries to paint in the (1, 1) coordinate, the editor will check the tile on 
the top coordinate that is this tile in the array of defined tile. If so, get the value of the bottom 
edge in the top coordinate, and do the similar steps with the left, bottom, and right sidesâ€™ coordinate. 
As the result, the editor can pick a tile that fits within the (1, 1) coordinate, but if there is no best 
solution, it will stay empty tile.
